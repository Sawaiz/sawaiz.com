# Leave in Condtioner

Hair needs to be condtioned, or so I hear. When it is properly condtioned it feels nice to run your hands though and falls into place properly. Normal condtioner is worked into the hair and let to sit for arround five miunes while still in the shower and then rinsed out. White it works well and is wonderful as the primary means of caring for the hair, furher stps can be taken.

Compared to hair conditioner familiar to most, leave in condtioner is applied with a fine mist spary to damp or dry hair and left in. Instead of having just a few minutes to work, leave in conditioner has all day to protect, repair, or soften the hair it is on.

It is sparyed into the hair and worked into all the fibers. Then the hair is brushed further working it in a setting hte hair for the shpae wanted when it dries. 

A light coat of a 3-4 sparys in short hair is barely noticable, while a heavy coat of 10-15 sprays provides distinct stucture and holds hair in place after it falls into place and dries.
