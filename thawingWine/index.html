        <p>How long does it take red wine bottle stored in a refrigerator to come to drinking temperature?</p>
    </header>

    <p>
        Red wine is supposed to be served at (15°C-18°C) with the range varying depending on varietal, not at
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_temperature#Serving_temperature_of_red_wine">modern room
            temperature</a>. Since most people still do not own climate controlled cellars, the bottle can either
        be held at a colder temperature in a refrigerator and thawed, or stored at room temperature and chilled.
    </p>

    <p>Since excessive heat and light exposure can also damage wine, its useful to explore the practicality of storage
        in a refrigerator. This
        can be calculated with thermal equations, but modeling will not be as accurate as a experiment.</p>

    <h2 id="procedure">Procedure</h2>

    <p>A form is created on google forms to collect data with accurate time stamping. A reminder is set about every four
        minutes to check and log the temperatures into the form.
    </p>
    <a href="./full/googleform.png"><img src="./googleForm.png" alt="Form for entering the data" /></a>

    <p>Two K-type thermocouples are attached to a glass bottle of room temperature oil to act as a low pass filter for
        any room temperature variations, and a bottle of red wine directly from the refrigerator. Both are placed on the
        same table with about a foot of separation.

    <h2 id="dataprocessing">Data Processing</h2>

    <p>The data was downloaded from Google Forms as a CSV, the first few lines of <a
            href="./data.csv"><em>data.csv</em></a> are shown below.</p>

    <pre>
    <code class="csv language-csv">
        "Timestamp","Air temp","Wine Temp"
        "2019/04/13 10:43:36 AM GMT+2","21.4","7.4"
        "2019/04/13 10:44:36 AM GMT+2","21.8","7.0"
        "2019/04/13 10:48:55 AM GMT+2","21.9","7.3"

        ...
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The file is simplified with <em>sed</em> to remove the AM/PM and timezone data, also <em>1 PM</em> is
        replaced with the 24hr format <em>13</em> and the formatted file is placed in <a
            href="./dataFormatted.csv"><em>dataFormatted.csv</em></a>.</p>

    <pre>
    <code class="bash language-bash">
        cat data.csv | \
        sed -E 's/ [APM]{2} GMT\+2//g' | \
        sed -E 's/ 1:([0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2})/ 13:\1/g' &gt; \
        dataFormatted.csv
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>A gnuplot file <a href="./chart.gnuplot">chart.gnuplot</a> is made to plot the data.</p>

    <pre>
    <code class="bash language-bash">
        gnuplot -c chart.gnuplot &gt; chart.png
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Another copy of the gnuplot file, <a href="./chartDelta.gnuplot">chartDelta.gnuplot</a>,
        is made and modified to calculate the delta (Control-Wine). This is run to generate the delta chart.</p>

    <pre>
    <code class="bash language-bash">
        gnuplot -c chartDelta.gnuplot &gt; \
        chartDelta.png
    </code>
    </pre>

    <h2 id="results">Results</h2>

    <p>Two charts are generated from the data set and are shown below.</p>
    <a href="./full/chart.png"><img src="./chart.png" alt="Control and Wine bottle temperature over time" /></a>

    <p>It takes approximately 105 minutes (1:45) for a bottle to enter the recommended (15°C-18°C) temperature range and
        further exposure to room temperature allows it to remain in that range for 75 minutes (1:15).</p>

            alt="Delta temperature removing environmental effects" /></a>
    <p>
        The recovery relationship is quite linear in this domain although it will become more asymptotic as wine
        temperature approaches air temperature.</p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

    <p>The approximately two hour wait is quite significant. If you live in a climate and have your heating set where
        your room temperature is generally below 21°C (70°F) and never exceeds 27°C (80°F), keep the bottles at room
        temperature and chill down in a refrigerator about 30 minutes before (determining this time requires a more
        complex experiment).
        Keeping it in the refrigerator after opening it for some time as well. This provides possibly double the time
        the bottle is in the ideal range.</p>

    <p>If living in a warmer climate, or with larger temperature fluctuations, keep the bottle at the top of the
        refrigerator, and suffer the time required for it to come up to temperature, or remove it far in advance and
        quickly chill again right before consumption, protecting the bottle from extended exposure.</p>
