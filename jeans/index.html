  </header>
  <p>Denim pants. A western wardrobe staple. </p>

  <h3>Sizing</h3>
  <p>
    The sizes are mesured in inches, waist by length. For example my size is 29x30 where 29" is proportional to my waist circumfrance, and 30" is proportional to my inseam. Of course proportional is the correct word to use as the sizing varies wildly by brand and even by style within a manufacturer, especially with vanity sizing. Its important to try them on for fit until you decide to settle on a model.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Material</h3>
  <p>
    Denim is a full cotton fabric (almost all womens' styles and a large poriton of mens styles add 1%-5% elastane also known as spandex for stretch) woven with a twill weave (chambray is a simlar matieral but is woven with a plain weave and with finer threads). The warp thread (runs pararell to the selvege) is dyed indigo while the weft (snakes though the warp back and forth) is left undeyed. Since the fabric is woven with a asymetric weave (weft travels over multiple warp threads in each pass) one side is lighter than the other.
  </p>

  <h3>Distressing</h3>
  <p>
    Buy clean denim and any distressing that happens will add charachter. Over the years they can be demoted down to yardwork pants from office and going out pants. Over they years thier qulaity has dropped and they are using thinner fabric to be able to provide new styles and more flexibilty since most jeans are no longer used by farmhands.
  </p>

  <h3>Button or Zipper</h3>
  <p>A zipper fly is most common on Jeans, but the classic button fly is more hard waring, less complex mechanically meaning it will last longer, and most importantly it lies flatter against the body. There is a learning curve involved in using it </p>

  <h3>Washes</h3>
  <p>Prefered washes (colors) are "Clean Rigid" (Levi's) as a dark indigo which is the classic color, and black. For fabrics that are indigo dyed, checking the obverse side to see the lighter color is a indicator of the correct weave used in the faric.</p>

  <h2>Levis 501 Shrink to Fit</h2>
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.levi.com">Levis Outlet Store </a>
  <p>$40 USD | 2018</p>
  </header>

  <p>The classic style, unwashed. Made from heavier 12.5oz denim, and a button fly with five buttons, one more than that standard 501, the shring to fit lies a bit more true to the heritage of the brand.</p>
  <p>If you are willing to put in the effort, there are few more authentic choices you can make, and its a worthwile investment. They come for the same price, but it is a lot more work though, firstly the size must be selected with shirkage in mind, and then optimaly should be soaked while wearing and then air dried while wearing they will leech indigo dye into the bathtub and your skin. Over time and multiple washings and continued wearing they will confrom to your body fading and feathering exactly to you, and the way you move.</p>
  <p>There is much further reserch if you go down this route. If I write a guide it will be [linked].</p>
  <p>When <a href="https://www.conedenim.com/tablet/white-oak.html">Cone Mills White Oak Denim</a> with selvege was availbile and a tremendous bargain, still I expect my pairs to age gracefully over the next decade.</p>
