  <p>
    Denim pants. A western wardrobe staple. 
  </p>

  <h3>Sizing</h3>
  <p>
    The sizes are mesured in inches, waist by length. For example my size is 29x30 where 29" is proportional to my waist circumfrance, and 30" is proportional to my inseam. Of course proportional is the correct word to use as the sizing varies wildly by brand and even by style within a manufacturer, especially with vanity sizing. Its important to try them on for fit until you decide to settle on a model.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Material</h3>
  <p>
    Denim is a full cotton fabric woven with a twill weave (chambray is a simlar matieral but is woven with a plain weave and with finer threads). The warp thread (runs pararell to the selvege) is dyed indigo while the weft (snakes though the warp back and forth) is left undeyed. Since the fabric is woven with a asymetric weave (weft travels over multiple warp threads in each pass) one side is lighter than the other.
  </p>

  <h3>Distressing</h3>
  <p>
    Buy clean denim and any distressing that happens will add charachter. Over the years they can be demoted down to yardwork pants from office and going out pants. Over they years thier qulaity has dropped and they are using thinner fabric to be able to provide new styles and more flexibilty since most jeans are no longer used by farmhands.
  </p>

  <h3>Button or Zipper</h3>
  <p>A zipper fly is most common on Jeans, but the classic button fly is more hard waring, less complex mechanically meaning it will last longer, and most importantly it lies flatter against the body. There is a learning curve involved in using it </p>

  <h3>Washes</h3>
  <p>Prefered washes (colors) are "Clean Rigid" (Levi's) as a dark indigo which is the classic color, and black. For fabrics that are indigo dyed, checking the obverse side to see the lighter color is a indicator of the correct weave used in the faric.</p>

  <p>The classic style, unwashed. Made from heavier 12.5oz denim, and a button fly with five buttons, one more than that standard 501, the shring to fit lies a bit more true to the heritage of the brand.</p>
  <p>If you are willing to put in the effort, there are few more authentic choices you can make. It is a lot more work though, firstly the size must be selected with </p>
    If you can find these in your matching size and are willing to put in the effort, its a worthwile investment. Not
    too much more expensive, this is a unwashed denim that will over time wear in with your bodys movements. They will
    fade exactly how you wear them.

    You need to do further reserch if you go down this route, the jeans must be purchased in a larger size, and will
    leach dye on first wearing or washing.

    Cone mills white oak denim with selvege is a amazing bargain at this price, and with enough work it will age
    bueatifully.
