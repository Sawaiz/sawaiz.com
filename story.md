## May 14
I had taken two weeks of vacation, I had been looking forward to what I would consider the closest thing to a vaction I have ever had. Gautam (like Batman's city), a friend from high school was going to be my first vistor before movin to Manhatan, and I was estatic to finally have someone to host.

Things had been rocky for a while at work, but you just get your startup legs after a couple months of runway. There is no such thing as a stable startup that has everything under control, if there was you forfit that title. I went thugh my preperations, delegated some tasks for the next few weeks, finialized some big archetectural decesions, and step by step walked my CEO through how to restart AWS servers or rollback a commit of code. I had a packed back to back schedule and would only have my phone on me in case something went really wrong.

My guest arrived and in under a day we were off. Flight to Athens, another to Rome, rail to Venice, and the with a early flight back to Berlin for just over aday this time. Then Amsterdam, Paris, and Marsilles all by rail, and flights to Barcelona and back to Berlin. Over fourteen days we walked around 130mi each spending two days everywhere but Paris and Rome. Fortunetly Germans take thier holidays very seriously, and will only call in emergencies, I had a few minor problems to check on and a few questions to answer but all was well.

## May 28
End of may came real fast, the next day, still exausted, but glad to have a day I get to sit all day roll into work arround ten. Nothing much had changed, I checked the servers and look in the metrics for anything abnormal and then move back to a database archiving project that was my priority. After a while the CEO, Timur, is in (we work some really wierd schedules), we exchange plesentries, tell a few annecdotes and then move to discussing what I missed. A few minor issues for me to take care of, advancedments in discussions with possible investors, TUV testing went well, smaple devices that need final assembly, oh, and our parent company has declared backrupcy but nothing is clear.

## January 2017
The parent company, Palmetto GmbH, is in the busness of managing plumbing systems for buildings. It's a fairly conservvetive business but good thing as germans are quite conservetive people. Their owner, managing director (thats not the right word, its Geshaftsfuehrer, but we are trying to deal with as little german minuta as possible), and CEO is Henning Heppner, and our company is just incorporated (same here, GmbH is close to Inc but not completely) with the full owner being Palmetto, the managing director being Henning and the only emploee, the CEO as Timur, working on a internaly project to "digitize water systems". Why the incorporation now, with a very basic prototype and pitching the possibilities of IoT, we got a seed round of 250,000 EUR for 30% from Teschnicheer Werke Ludwigafen, TWL, the water municipality of a whole city. Thier plan, to inovate and head into new markts using the incredible trust they have with thier customers. One of their directors becomes the other managing director, a advisory board is formed with two people from TWL and two From Palmetto and a independent industry expert.

## May 28
Oh, okay. It's just the parent company that has a 51% of our company, It shouldnt effect our next round of funding, we despretely need that since after May saleries (paid at the end of each month), we might just be able to barely pay June saleries. 

## October 2018
We had promised a Minimum viable product (MVP) by November 2018, we have a presale of 500 units as well as well as the next round of funding at 250,000 for a further 19%, so we defintly have our motivations. Significant redesigns as well as definety not enough of a techncal team (me, a web developer, and our data scientist) meant it got pushed back to th end of the year. Developing hardware is far slower than iterating on software which is always a challenge to explain. A few bridge loans were made in the process to make sure we had money, loaned equally from both shareholders. They want twenty working devies to test and if it is a MVP, we are good.

## May 28
Oh, money troubles in a startup, could you tell a more unoriginal story. The next round is right arround the corner though, ther are contracts and everything.

## January 2019
Its the New Year, we have MVP, but no cash in the bank. While we worked long hours, ran extensive tests, and made bulletproof hardware, multiple firmwares, hand soldered hundreds of tiny componets, a stable web app interface, and a working agorythm for dtetcting leaks, TWL was going though some ousting. the old Vorstand (president comes closest I think) was forced out and a new one took his place, Thomas Mosul. Apparely the older one made quite a few risky investments into other startups and Mosul is on a mission to minimize losses if possible. Instead of quickly testing the devices internally as agreed on, a new a greement was made. The testing will be done by an independt agency TUV, a badge of thier approval is extremely prestigous, and it souldnt take too long, another loan will be given to keep the company alive while this test is done. As soon as the results come in, the board will interpret them and we will get the money if we passed or we are done if we fail.

I dont think I have enough faith to wait a few months for a sallary transfer again. At this point our data scientist, Amir, is in, and in a rare turn we all agree.

## March 2019
We are one of the few investments of TWL left, we had recived further loans to keep us alive, they take a while to actucally go though all the burocracy and after a few months we have money again. I mean we are arround 180k in debt right now 90k eachto Palmetto and TWL, but at least we can pay our emploees again. Timur and I had deffered our salleries for two months so we could continue paying the other emploeeys, since he has a wife to suppourt him and I had at this point finally built up considerable savings to feel comfortable in Germany. The others were living the normal european idea of keping no savings and living month to month. Not mine to judge, but I don't care how strong a safety net there is... I digress. We sill only have funding for a few more months, but at least I got paid for the last two months.

## May 28
As soon as the final tests from TUV are finalized, oh yeah, any new news from them? Amir and Timur had been in Ludwigsaften helping and monitoring the tests being done by TUV.

## May 2019
The TUV tests were suppoused to start and have finsihed weeks ago, everything, TWL had been stalling and vastly underestimated what it would take to run these tests, is finally ready and I am to leave on vacation the weekend right before the test starts. I had planned on leaving after in case I was needed in a emegency or to accompony the testers to aswer any thchnical questions, but tickets and accomodation have been booked, and Gautham lands at the end of the week, and I'm definetly going.

## May 28
In regards to the TUV test, everything had gone well and we had a copy of thier collected data whcih showed our system worked rather well. The plan is with half the tsting done, we will recive a pelimery report from TUV, and the decesion will be made. The tester was nice, and the results look good. So the report should be here any day now. When the money comes in we can finally hire new staff, or at least replace our web developer who left a few months ago to move to Swisserland iwth his partner, and I had taken over a new role of, web archetecture, devops, backend, and frontend devlepoment. Buy new computers, get the raise accociated with MVP finally, and get the bonuses I'm owed for over a year ago.

## March 2018
Just two emploees still, very close to hirhing our third. I have a yearly perfomance based bonus of 6000 EUR. This is my fourth time asking about it, and the response I alwys get is the same. You need to make a document stating your goals and what you accomplished in the previous year, give yourself a percentage and have Henning sign off of how much you deserve. I dont skip a beat with my response, this is not a grade yourself thing, if it is I deserve 100%. No major funding problems so I wouldnt be a problem, but I want the managing director, Henning, to grade my performance, or just give me 100% out of principle, of course every time i bring it up, neither happens. Timur gave himself a score of 90% and collected his bonus, but it would be very out of charachter for me to rate my performance as not stellar.

## May 28
I konw you both are also owed your bonuses, but I'm owed at least 12k, for multiple years, not to mention the MVP bomus promised. I'm definetly not paid enough, and even the ESOP wouldn't make up for it if that is even ever signed, no news on that front either, right?

## August 2018
ESOP

## July 1 2017
