# Fried Chicken
Tea brinded fried chicken. I tried buttermilk brining, and the flavour profile really didnt work. 

You will want to get at least two scales. 0-5kg range with 1g resolution, and a 0-100g wiht 0.01g resolution. If you can get the whole range in 0.01g resolution that is a much more expensive scale.

This recipie is designed with chicken breast for a few reasons.
- I cant figure out where or how to get boneless chicken thighs in Germany
- Have still not built the consitution to try cutting up a whole chicken.
- Consistancy in the tests. Chicken breasts are all very similar.

Chicken
- 600G Chicken Breast (3 full pieces)

Brining Solution
- 2.5g Tea
- 10g Salt
- 10g Sugar
- 200g Water

Bring water to boil, add salt and sugar, stir to dissolve. Remove from heat and add tea and steep for five minutes. Strain and cool to room temprature. Brine chicken pieces (~1.5 in Cubes) for 20h.

Dredging mixute
- 150g 405 Flour
- 20g Cornstarch
- 5.00g Sugar
- 15.00g salt
- 5.00g Ground red pepper
- 1.00g Fresh Ground black pepper
- 1.00g Garlic Powder
- 0.50g Baking Powder

Mix dredging mixture together and place into a sealable container. Add a few chicken pieces, toss vigorously to coat with lid. Remove and sieve chicken and flour clumps. Repeat with all chciken.

- 50g Egg (Single medium egg)
- 50g Bringing solution

Result:

Too much salt, too much garlic powder in coating. Baking powder has no effect, might not be neeed. Try adding baking soda into brine to improve surface adhesion and texture. Sugar in the dredge/coating can probably be removed. More black pepper would be nice, but the grinding would need to be moved to a mortar and pestle, my ands can only take so much.

Breading well adhered

Smaller batches are needed, out of flour mixture, time between breadings too long.

Rest period enough for oil to come up to temp, too long and breading adheres to work surface.

Magage and mantain oil temp. Use Picoscope and thermocouple logging to get temprature graphs (Already ordered AD8495 K-type analog amplifiers).

## Stove cooking power calibration
- [ ] There needs to be a way to calibrate cooking power across stoves.
- [ ] Needs to mesure effective watts input into food.
- [ ] Take into account the pan used
- [ ] Sandardized vessel to calibrate with (12" Lodge cast iron skillet!)
